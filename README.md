# xmir
Web server fingerprinting with MASSCAN

## What does it do?
- xmir uses a XML result file generated by MASSCAN as its input file. 
- Analyzes banners in the XML to filter out needed servers. 
- If that's not enough to recognize the server, it tries to grab a web page from that server for further fingerprinting.

## Supported Servers

- [x] Joomla
- [x] WordPress
- [ ] WebLogic
- [ ] Struts2
- [ ] MS IIS
